	Brett Lee (born 8 November 1976) is a former Australian international cricketer, who played all three formats of the game. During his international career, Lee was recognised as one of fastest bowlers in the world of cricket along with Shoaib Akhtar. He is known for his consistency of pace, going over 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph) throughout his career. His quickest delivery was 161.8 km/h (100.5 mph) in a test match against the West Indies in 2002, but because they were playing in a charity match, it was not officially recognised as the fastest delivery ever. After that the world record for the fastest delivery ever is held by Shoaib Akhtar at 161.4 km/h (100.3 mph). Lee's quickest delivery in ODIs is 161.1 km/h (100.1 mph) playing against New Zealand in 2005. He is also widely regarded as one of the best pace bowlers ever to have played the sport.
